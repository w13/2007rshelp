<p>At the dawn of time in the RuneScape realm, the chef of Lumbridge Castle was in chaos. It was the Duke's birthday, and he did not have the ingredients for a birthday cake! The cook asked every passing player, to assist him in gathering the ingredients for the birthday cake, many of who obliged. The chef has asked for little help since then, but the time has now come; RuneScape's one-hundredth quest! The RuneScape development team claim this is one of the longest, most taxing quests to fully complete.</p>

<p>By fully, we mean: completing the introduction quest, and the eight sub-quests associated with the Chef. Below the introduction to the quest you will find a table showing the other eight sub-quests, with quick-links to the guides.</p>

<div class="quote">The cook in Lumbridge has a surprisingly small number of ingredients to hand in his kitchen, possibly as a result of an endless stream of newcomers with light fingers taking anything that isn't nailed down from his kitchen.<br />

Luckily, in the past a kind Cooks Assistant was willing to help him in his culinary duties, but now a problem has appeared that could spell... a Recipe For Disaster!<br />

Almost all members may attempt to solve his tricky predicament, and be rewarded accordingly, but only the very elite of questers will be able to put paid to his problem permanently!</div>

<hr />

<p>1) To begin, speak to the Cook of Lumbridge Castle. He'll inform you of a special dinner that occurs every ten years (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/1_meeting.png">Picture</a>). However, this time, he is faced with a problem. As usual, he is missing the ingredients! Will you help him collect them?<br />
  <i>Strategy: Teleport to <a href="/cities.php?id=4" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Lmbridge City Guide">Lumbridge</a> to get there quickly.</i></p>

<p>2) If you agree to help him, he will give you a list of items for you to collect: rotten tomato, eye of newt, Greenman's ale, and a dirty blast. While you're here, you should head over to the <a href="/misc.php?id=32" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Duel Arena Guide">Duel Arena</a>, and buy a rotten tomato from Fadli. From there, you can either go to Betty's magic emporium in <a href="/cities.php?id=11" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Port Sarim City Guide">Port Sarim</a>, or Jatix's herblore store, in <a href="/cities.php?id=18" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Taverley City Guide">Taverley</a> to buy an eye of newt.<br />
<i>Strategy: Rub a ring of dueling to get to the duel arena quickly. If you wish to go to Taverley, you could  use a games room necklace then walk south, or teleport to <a href="/cities.php?id=17" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Falador City Guide">Falador</a>, and hop over the west wall.</i></p>

<p>3) Once you have an eye of newt and rotten tomato, head to the Grand Tree. Make your way to the second floor of the Grand Tree, and speak to Blurberry, on the eastern branch.  Obtain a Fruit Blast (either mix one, or buy one from his store), and use ashes with it, to make a Dirty Blast (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/2_dirtyblast.png">Picture</a>). <br />
<i>Strategy: If in <a href="/cities.php?id=18" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Taverley City Guide">Taverley</a>, take the glider from White Wolf Mountain to the Grand Tree.<br />
Notes: If you haven't previously mixed drinks for Blurberry, you will have to do a few trials for him, until you can make a Fruit Blast; make it.<br />
Fruit Blast: Pick up a cocktail glass from the ground, or ask a Bartender for one, and  buy one pineapple, one orange, two lemons, and a cocktail shaker from Heckel Funch. Place the pineapple, orange, and one lemon in the cocktail shaker; shake it up and use the mixture in the empty cocktail glass. Slice a lemon, and use it on the unfinished cocktail.
<br />
</i><i>If you are a bartender for him, you can buy a Fruit Blast from his store for 30gp.</i></p>

<p>4) Finally, make your way to the Dragon Inn - <a href="/cities.php?id=12" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Yanille City Guide">Yanille</a>'s pub - and buy a Greenman's ale. You should now have all the required ingredients. Report back to the Cook, and give him the ingredients; he'll invite you to join the spectacular feast! (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/3_dining.png">Picture</a>).<br />
<i>Strategy: Teleport to <a href="/cities.php?id=12" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Yanille City Guide">Yanille</a> using the "Watchtower Teleport" spell. To get to <a href="/cities.php?id=4" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Lumbridge City Guide">Lumbridge</a> quickly, just teleport.</i></p>

<center><hr noshade="noshade" width="300" /></center><br />
<div class="title3">The Fiasco </div>
<p>Once you have received your reward, you can enter the dining room; triggering a cut-scene. You will be introduced to each one of the members present (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/4_introductions.png">Picture</a>) by Duke Horacio, who will then leave unexpectedly. Soon after he leaves, the culinaromencer appears and attacks everyone. Fortunately, the <a href="/cities.php?id=22" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Varrock City Guide">Varrock</a> Gypsy arrives and stops time within the dining room. Ask her about the culinaromencer, and she will tell you that he used to be a cook in Lumbridge Castle a hundred years ago (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/5_cook.png">Picture</a>). He used the food to experiment with his powers; when this was discovered, he was banished to another dimension. The making of the same feast a hundred years later, allowed him to return. Apparently this fiasco was all your fault, as you helped the Cook make this meal, by collecting the ingredients (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/6_ingredients.png">Picture</a>), the gypsy asks you to help rescue the members of the group, and  kill the culinaromencer once and for all - to put a stop to his evil magic.</p>

<p>1) The gypsy says that the trapped dwarf’s father, Rohak, may know how to make his son’s favorite recipe. She says he is located under White Wolf Mountain.</p>

<p>2) Go speak with Rohak (labelled as "An Old Dwarf"). After trying to convince him of his son’s predicament (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/dwarf/ca21.png">Picture</a>) he will still refuse to give up the recipe. He mentions that not even his favorite beer at the Rising Sun pub in <a href="/cities.php?id=17" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Falador City Guide">Falador</a> will make him give it up.</p>

<p>3) Head to the pub and talk to the barmaid. For 200gp she will tell you that dwarves love beer with coins dropped in them. Buy 4 or 5 beers and drop 1gp in each of them. Head back to Rohak and give him the beers (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/dwarf/ca22.png">Picture</a>).<br />
<i>Strategy: Wear a ring of charos (u) to charm the barmaid the barmaid into giving you the recipe for free.</i></p>

<p>4) Rohak will agree to make you the rock-cakes if you bring him a bucket of milk, a pot of flour, a bowl of water, and an egg. Bring these to him. He will make you some rock-cakes.</p>

<p>5) Head back to <a href="/cities.php?id=4" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Lumbridge City Guide">Lumbridge</a> and use the rock cakes with the dwarf. The gypsy will tell you they need to be cooled down, and to do so you must go to Ice Mountain.</p>

<p>6) Travel to the top of Ice Mountain. You will see several Ice Fiends (level 13). Kill one with the rock cake in your inventory and it will cool the cake down. Deliver the cake to the dwarf in Lumbridge Castle.<br />
<i>Wear Ice Gloves to pick up the cake and cool it instead of going to Ice Mountain.</i></p>

<hr />

<p>1) The gypsy tells you that you might find clues as to what they both like at their Goblin Village. Head north of <a href="/cities.php?id=17" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Falador City Guide">Falador</a> to find it.</p>

<p>2) In the east building there is a ladder. Climb down the ladder to find the Goblin Cook (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/goblins/ca26.png">Picture</a>). He will say that he cannot help you with your quest until he gets an important ingredient – charcoal. Give it to him (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/goblins/ca25.png">Picture</a>).</p>

<p>3) He will add the ingredient (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/goblins/ca27.png">Picture</a>). The room explodes! You stand aghast as the goblin proclaims that his exploding recipe was a success, all thanks to you (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/goblins/ca29.png">Picture</a>). You may now ask him for help (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/goblins/ca28.png">Picture</a>).</p>

<p>4) He will tell you that both generals prefer different things, and you will need the following (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/goblins/ca31.png">Picture</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&raquo;</b> Orange slices that aren’t orange</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&raquo;</b> Maggots that aren’t bland</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&raquo;</b> Bread which isn’t crunchy</li>
</ul>

<p>5) The bread is easy enough. Use your water with your loaf of bread to produce Soggy Bread.</p>

<p>6) Use your spices with the fishing bait to produce Spicy Maggots.</p>

<p>7) Use your blue dye with your orange slices to produce oranges that aren’t bland.</p>

<p>8) Take all three ingredients back to the goblin cook and he will mix them together. Take the "Slop of Compromise" (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/goblins/ca32.png">Picture</a>) back to the goblin generals and use it with them.</p>

<p>1) Inspect Pirate Pete. His favorite food is fishcakes. The gypsy tells you to talk to the Lumbridge Cook to find the recipe. He tells you the four main ingredients are:</p>

<div class="title3">The recipe is:</div>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&raquo;</b> Breadcrumbs</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&raquo;</b> Ground Codfish</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&raquo;</b> Ground Kelp </li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&raquo;</b> Ground Giant Crab Meat</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&raquo;</b> Mix together and cook on a range.</li>
</ul>

<p>2) To obtain breadcrumbs, use a knife with your loaf of bread.</p>

<p>3) To obtain some Ground Codfish you will need a big fishing net. Fish at a big fishing net spot to get a Codfish, then use the raw Codfish with a mortar and pestle.</p>

<p>4) The Lumbridge Cook says that Murphy in <a href="/cities.php?id=21" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Port Khazard City Guide">Port Khazard</a> may know how to get crab meat and kelp. Head to <a href="/cities.php?id=21" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Port Khazard City Guide">Port Khazard</a> and speak with Murphy (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/pete/ca18.png">Picture</a>).</p>

<p>5) He will tell you that in order to get kelp you must dive in the ocean, and he needs a fishbowl to make the proper equipment. Give him a fishbowl and he will give you a Fishbowl Helmet and a Diving Apparatus. Equip these, and make sure your total wait is less than 27kg. Speak to Murphy again to begin diving (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/pete/ca15.png">Picture</a>).</p>

<p>6) Once in the water, head a bit north and you will see some kelp plants on the ground. Pick some and leave the water. Use the kelp with your pestle and mortar.</p>

<p>7) To get the crab meat you must once again go diving. Once you are in the water, head north. You will see a guarded pen of crabs, but in order to get to them you must talk to a large swimming Mogre named Nung. He will let you have some crabs… for a price. He wants 5 mudskipper hides (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/pete/ca17.png">Picture</a>).</p>

<p>8) Head out of the pen area and to the west. You will see a cave. Pick up several rocks around the cave until you are allowed to enter it. Kill 5 Mudskippers (level 30 and 31). Bring the hides back to Nung (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/pete/caa18.png">Picture</a>).</p>

<p>9) Nung isn’t quite satisfied. He wants to make the skins into fishing gear. He requires a needle and three bronze wires to do the job. Give these to him and he will allow you access to the crab pen. Get some crab meat and use it with a mortar and pestle.<br />
<i>Hint: If you bring a chisel into the crab pen and use it with certain crab "parts" that are dropped (claw, shell, etc) you can make wearable items.</i></p>

<p>10) Go back to <a href="/cities.php?id=4" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Lumbridge City Guide">Lumbridge</a> with the four ingredients. The Lumbridge Cook will tell you to use them with each other and then use them on a range. Use the finished product on Pirate Pete.</p>

<hr />
<p>1) The Gypsy tells you that you will need to make a Cake of Guidance in order to free the Lumbridge Guide. She informs you that Wizard Traiborn in Draynor's Wizard tower can help you make the cake..<br />
<i>Strategy: Before heading to the Wizard's Tower, you will need to bring along the ingredients for a regular cake. The egg is located north of Lumbridge Castle in the chicken coops across from the cow field. The pot of flour and the bucket of milk can be quickly bought in the food store in the Gnome Stronghold. Cake tins can be found in most General Stores throughout the game or inside the <a href="/guilds.php?id=7" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Cooks' Guild Guide">Cooks' Guild</a>. Use an amulet of glory to quickly teleport to <a href="/cities.php?id=19" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Draynor Village City Guide">Draynor Village</a> and run south to the tower.</i></p>

<p>2) The wizard in located one story up from the ground level. When you speak to him, he will tell you that to make a Cake of Knowledge, you will need the ingredients needed to make a normal cake. Return to him once you have all the ingredients or talk to him once you are prepared.</p>

<p>3) When you speak to him, he will tell you that you will need to pass a quiz of three questions in order to enchant each ingredient of the cake. The first item enchanted is the egg. To pass this test, you will need to identify certain NPCs by sight (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/lumby/ca35.png">Picture</a>). The examine feature will not help you. If you answer all three questions correctly in a row, he will enchant the egg and hold onto for the time being (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/lumby/ca36.png">Picture</a>).<br />
<i>Strategy: This quiz is most likely randomized so you will need to recall key people from previous quests. If the NPC is wearing or carrying a certain item, this will help you answer the questions.</i></p>

<p>4) Talk to him and again and he will offer to enchant the bucket of milk. This time, you will need to answer three questions about the geography of the game. As before, you must answer all three questions correctly in a row to enchant the milk. If you succeed, he will enchant the milk and hold onto it for the time being.<br />
<i>Strategy: It would be helpful to pull up the World Map from Runescape's website to look at to better answer your questions.</i></p>

<p>5) Talk to him one final time and he will enchant your flour. This time, you will need to look at an image of ten different items. Once you close the window, you will need to answer a question about them. The question could be how many items are weapons or what item shown begins with the letter "M" (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/lumby/ca34.png">Picture</a>). Answer three questions correctly in a row and he will enchant the flour.<br />
<i>Strategy: There is no time limit for studying the items so you ay either may write them down on a sheet of paper or take a screenshot of them to use as reference to answer the questions.</i></p>

<p>6) Once all three items are enchanted, he will hand them back to you and tell you that you need to make the cake just like a normal one. Use the pot of flour with the cake tin to make an unfinished cake mix and use this on a range to bake the cake (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/lumby/ca37.png">Picture</a>).<br />
<i>Strategy: It would be best to teleport back to <a href="/cities.php?id=4" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Lumbridge City Guide">Lumbridge</a> and use the cook's range to bake this cake.</i></p>

<p>7) Go back to the dining room in Lumbridge Castle and use the Cake of Knowledge on the Lumbridge Guide.</p>

<hr /><br /><br />

<p>1) Inspect Evil Dave, and you will find out that you have to make a stew, which has to be seasoned in a particular way. To find the recipe, you must talk to someone who has tasted it. You have to talk to Evil Dave in <a href="/cities.php?id=24" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Edgevile City Guide">Edgeville</a> to find out (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/dave/1_stew.png">Picture</a>).</p>

<p>2) Go to <a href="/cities.php?id=24" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Edgeville City Guide">Edgeville</a> and talk to Evil Dave. He is living in the Basement, in the house just west of the Bank. Talk to him, and you will get a list of options which you use to explain about the time bubble. Pick the 4th option and he will tell you to ask his mom for the recipe, eventually.<br />
  <i>Strategy: Buy around 10 bowls, fill them in the sink in the Lumbridge Castle courtyard, then get the remaining ingredients for the stew: potatoes, and cooked meat. Make the stews then teleport to <a href="/cities.php?id=24" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Edgeville City Guide">Edgeville</a> using a Glory Amulet. You may also make a Waka Canoe, or the one below it.</i></p>

<p>3) Go upstairs and talk to Doris. Ask her for the spices to make a stew, and she will say that Dave's Hell-rats stole them all (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/dave/2_rat.png">Picture</a>).</p>

<p>4) Go back downstairs, and catch hell-rats till you get various spices.</p>

<p>5) Take the stews to Lumbridge Castle. Use one spice on the stew, and try it on Evil Dave, if it is the right one he will say you got x number of spices right and eat it. If not, Dave will say it's all wrong and eat the stew anyways. Make a note of how many spices you put in for it to be right.<br />
Once you have all 4 spice quantities correct add them all into a bowl of stew and give it to him. He will say it is the right stew (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/dave/3_evilstew.png">Picture</a>). You will then be rewarded. Do not log out while testing the spices on Dave or you will have to go through the process again.<br />
<i>Strategy: Teleport to <a href="/cities.php?id=4" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Edgeville City Guide">Lumbridge</a>. You may also choose to make a Canoe.</i></p>

<p>1) The gypsy says that the trapped Ogre likes Jubbly. She says he is in the Feldip Hills.</p>

<p>2) Head to eastern Feldip hills and speak with Rantz, he will tell you to meet him south east of there.</p>

<p>3) Go Southeast talk with him and he will tell you that he wants to go to Karamja first and that you need to help him get there, you will recommend making a boat. And he will knock down a tree and says that he needs help. Use your hatchet with the fallen tree.</p>

<p>4) Talk to him and again and you will say that the boat is still not done, once again use your axe with it.</p>

<p>5) After this, he will shoot an arrow at <a href="/cities.php?id=36" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Tai Bwo Wannai City Guide">Tai Bwo Wannai</a>. You must then go find the arrow, and cook the chompy in that spot.</p>

<p>6) Head over to <a href="/cities.php?id=36" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Tai Bwo Wannai City Guide">Tai Bwo Wannai</a> and go to the western side of the city, you should see an arrow sticking out of a tree (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/skrach/4.PNG">Picture</a>). Use your Iron Spit with your chompie, light a fire with your tinderbox, and then use your chompie with the fire. Once you do this the ogre boat will arrive, and Rantz’s children will ask if you want to come back to Feldip hills. Tell them that you do and you will be transported back near Rantz.</p>

<p>7) Talk to Rantz and he will explain vaguely what you need to do to find a Jubbly. First use your ogre bellows with a frog that’s hopping on the ground, second use the bellows with the same frog. Next got northwest of where you caught the frog and mine a rock from the mining area. Now use your frog with the rock to make a balloon frog.</p>

<p>8) Now travel to an area where it allows you to drop your balloon frog, and drop it. After a few seconds a Jubbly will appear, kill it with your Ogre Bow. Pluck it feathers (you don‘t need to keep the feathers), then pick up the Jubbly meat.</p>

<p>9) Head over to where you first talked to Rantz, and cook the Jubbly meat on the Ogre Spit Roast.</p>

<p>10) Now head back to Lumbridge Castle, and use the Cooked Jubbly Meat with the frozen Rantz.</p>

<hr />

<p>1) Inspect Sir Amik. The gypsy will tell you that you are to make a Cr&egrave;me Brul&egrave; supreme. She also tells you to talk to the Cook in Lumbridge Castle for more assistance. </p>

<p>2) Talk to him, and even though you haven't saved Sir Amik yet, the Cook thinks you have completed the quest because of the time dilation effect. Ask him about how you saved Sir Amik and he will tell you about the recipe.</p>

<div class="title3">The recipe (summarized) is:</div>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&raquo;</b> Blend together some milk and cream in a pot (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/amik/2_recipe.png">Picture</a>).</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&raquo;</b> Add cornflour to the mixture (use sweetcorn in a mill - <a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/amik/3_recipe.png">Picture</a>).</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&raquo;</b> Add a Vanilla Stick to the mixture (Kharazi Jungle - <a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/amik/4_recipe.png">Picture</a>).</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&raquo;</b> Add an egg from the Evil Chicken (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/amik/5_chickenegg.png">Picture</a>).</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&raquo;</b> Make some cinnamon and sprinkled it on top of the Cr&egrave;me Brul&egrave; (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/amik/6_cinnamon.png">Picture</a>).</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&raquo;</b> The Cr&egrave;me Brul&egrave; has to be flamb&egrave;ed by the heat of dragon breath (Dragon Fairy - <a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/amik/7_dragon.png">Picture</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>3) Firstly, the easy parts. Grab 2 buckets and milk a dairy cow. The closest churn is in Fred's farm (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/amik/9_churn.png">Picture</a>), North of <a href="/cities.php?id=4" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Lumbridge City Guide">Lumbridge</a>. Use 1 bucket of milk and churn it into a pot of cream. You now have two of the ingredients. Also, while you're at it, stop by the windmill and grind the sweetcorn.</p>

<p>4) Go to <a href="/cities.php?id=19" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Draynor City Guide">Draynor</a> and talk to the Wise Old Man about the Evil Chicken. He tells you that there is a coven of witches who can summon it in a fabled fairy kingdom (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/amik/10_fairies.png">Picture</a>). He also tells you to go there if you wanted to look for the Evil Chicken. <br />
  <i>Strategy: Rub an Amulet of Glory to teleport to <a href="/cities.php?id=19" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Draynor City Guide">Draynor</a>.</i></p>

<p>5) Go to <a href="/cities.php?id=13" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Zanaris City Guide">Zanaris</a> and you will see the Chicken Shrine right away. Use a raw chicken on it, and you will enter the Black Dragon Lair. Kill a black dragon (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/amik/11_blkdragon.png">Picture</a>), and pick up the Dragon Token. Go North, and you will see an Evil Chicken (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/amik/12_evilchick.png">Picture</a>). Kill it, and grab the egg. <br />
  <i>Strategy: For the Dragon, protect from melee is recommended. If you want to avoid damage from its fire-breath, drink a dose of anti-fire potion. If your prayer runs low, drink a dose of prayer potion and continue fighting. For the Chicken, turn on protect from Magic and you should do just fine with no damage.</i></p>

<p>6) Your next stop is the Kharazi Jungle. Head to the southwestern most corner of the Jungle and make your way east. You will eventually find the Vanilla Plant. Search it to get a Vanilla pod. Only one last ingredient left.<br />
  <i>Strategy: There are two good ways to get to the Jungle. Teleport to <a href="/cities.php?id=15" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Ardougne City Guide">Ardougne</a>, take the boat ride to <a href="/cities.php?id=7" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Brimhaven City Guide">Brimhaven</a>, then hitch a ride on Hajedy's Cart. you will end up in <a href="/cities.php?id=2" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Shilo Village City Guide">Shilo Village</a> soon. The second way is to Teleport using an Amulet of Glory. Head west until you reach <a href="/cities.php?id=7" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Brimhaven City Guide">Brimhaven</a>, then get a rid from Hajedy. From there, exit the village and enter the jungle. Food may be required in the Jungle if you get attacked by Jungle Wolves.</i></p>

<p>7) Now head to <a href="/cities.php?id=9" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Entrana City Guide">Entrana</a> and make your way to the Dungeon. Remember, this is only a one way ladder, so make sure you have a way to get out. Kill a zombie till you get an axe, then chop a branch off the Dramen Tree. Use it on a pestle and mortar to get cinnamon. Then use the cinnamon on the brul&egrave; mix that you have so far. You have only one thing left to do: Flamb&egrave;ing (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/amik/13_laststep.png">Picture</a>).<br />
  <i>Strategy: Teleport to <a href="/cities.php?id=19" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Draynor Village City Guide">Draynor</a> using an Amulet of Glory, then walk to <a href="/cities.php?id=11" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Port Sarim City Guide">Port Sarim</a>. If not, you may Teleport to <a href="/cities.php?id=17" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Falador City Guide">Falador</a> and walk south until you get to Port Sarim. Remember, you can't have anything in your inventory, except Teleport runes and/or Jewellery.</i></p>

<p>8) Rub the Dragon Token you received from killing the Black Dragon. You will have a short conversation with the Fairy Dragon, and it will allow you to ask one thing. Pick the first option, and you will ask it to flamb&egrave; the Cr&egrave;me Brul&egrave; for you (<a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/amik/15_flambe.png">Picture</a>). Once it's done, go to Lumbridge Castle Dining room, and use the Cr&egrave;me Brul&egrave; to rescue Sir Amik Varze.<br />
<i>Strategy: Teleport to <a href="/cities.php?id=4" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Lumbridge City Guide">Lumbridge</a> to save time.</i></p>

<p>1) The gypsy does not know what the Monkey Ambassador likes, so she tells you to go ask him in <a href="/cities.php?id=5" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Ape Atoll City Guide">Ape Atoll</a>. </p>

<p>2) Head over to <a href="/cities.php?id=5" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Ape Atoll City Guide">Ape Atoll</a>, being in the normal brown monkey form. Head to the building south of the temple (in the eastern part of town) and talk to Awowogei about what his favorite food is. He won’t tell you what it is, but he will mention that three monkeys do know what it is.</p>

<p>3) Head into the Temple and go the north western corner and talk to one of the three monkeys. They will eventually tell you that you need a banana, a monkey nut, and a snake corpse.</p>

<p>4) In town there is a shopkeeper named Solihib who sells both monkey nuts and bananas, buy both from him.</p>

<p>5) To get a snake corpse got to crash island and go towards the middle of the island and you should see a pit <a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/awowogei/pit4su.png">(Picture)</a>, go down it and kill a snake for a snake corpse.</p>

<p>6) Go back to the three monkeys and talk to them again. They will tell you that both your banana and Monkey Nuts are the wrong kind. Your banana should be a red banana, and your nuts should be Tchiki monkey nuts.</p>

<p>7) To get the red banana head directly west until you find a read banana tree. Switch to your gorilla monkey form and use your rope with the tree. Get at least 2 red bananas by dropping the then using the rope with the tree again <a href="/img/qimg/recipedisaster/awowogei/redbanana8xh.png">(Picture></a>.</p>

<p>8) Getting the Tchiki Nuts requires an agile monkey form. Switch to your ninja monkey form and go to the southern part of town until you come to the agility course. Follow the agility course until after you swing across on the vine. You should see a hole, go down it and pick the monkey nuts from the bush. Once again make sure you get at least two, by dropping them then picking the bush again.</p>

<p>9) Head back to the three monkeys and talk to them again, they will eat one of your bananas and nuts then the third time you talk to them they will tell you that you must cook your stuffed snake below the temple.</p>

<p>10) First cut your red banana into slices with your knife, then grind your Tchiki nuts with your pestle and mortar. Now use the banana slices with your snake corpse, and then your nut paste with the stuffed snake.</p>

<p>11) Now head to the eastern side of the temple and go down the trapdoor. Once you have gone down, head east and look for a hole in the wall labelled "Exit". Switch to your Zombie monkey form and head inside. Head to the rock that looks like a snake and use your stuffed snake on it.</p>

<p>12) Once you have a cooked stuffed snake, head back to <a href="/cities.php?id=4" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Lumbridge City Guide">Lumbridge</a> and use the snake on the monkey ambassador. He will first tell you how to do the Teleport to Ape Atoll spell, then he will give you your reward.</p>
