<p><strong>What is Zchat?</strong> <br / >

<span style="display:block; margin-left:15px;">Zchat is Zybez's official Friend Chat. In OSRS (Old School Runescape) it also functions as Zybez's Clan Chat.</span>
</p>
<p><strong>How do I connect in OSRS?</strong><br />
<span style="display:block; margin-left:15px;">Connecting is very simple. Ingame, click on the tab that looks like this:<br />

You'll be taken to the tab that looks like this:<br />

Then simply hit <em>"Join Chat"</em> and type <em>"Zchat"</em> in the box that pops up:<br />

hit the Enter key and you're in.<br /> Players can type in the chat by using two forwards slashes like so:<br />
<em>//Hello chat!</em></span></p>

<p><strong>Are there any rules I need to follow?</strong><br />
<span style="display:block; margin-left:15px;">The Zchat rules can be found in <a href="https://forums.zybez.net/topic/1561829-zchat/">this topic</a> along with any updates that happen in the chat.</span></p>

<p><strong>Can I buy or sell stuff in the chat?</strong><br />
<span style="display:block; margin-left:15px;">Buying or selling is allowed, but please do not spam up the chat. We recommend using the <a href="https://forums.zybez.net/runescape-2007-prices">OSRS Price Guide</a> for all your OSRS marketing needs.</span></p>

<p><strong>I've been banned from the chat, what do I do now?</strong>
<span style="display:block; margin-left:15px;">If you have been kicked from the chat, your ban will expire in an hour. If you have been permanently banned from the chat and you feel this was a mistake or you wish to appeal the ban, please use the Appeals form located <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGJ5cldpd1VmXzMzRGlmRnBIMHlSN3c6MQ">here</a>.</p></span><br /><br />
