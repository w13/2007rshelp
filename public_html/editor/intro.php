<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><b>What:</b> The Zybez RuneScape Help Content Team consists of a large group of RuneScape experts who enjoy sharing their knowledge with other players.</p>

<p><b>What we do:</b> Develop new content; update current content; maintain content through correction submissions; update graphics for content; maintain the Zybez databases, and most importantly, we INNOVATE.</p>

<a name="2"></a>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>This briefly defines the goals of the Content Team:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Quality</strong> | <strong>Detail</strong> | <strong>Enthusiasm</strong> | <strong>Innovation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Quality:</strong> Maintaining quality and our professional appearance is our primary goal. The quality of our guides is achieved through ensuring that all members of the team are proficient in their literacy skills, and are properly instructed on how to develop them. Becoming part of the Content Team is a rigorous process, seeing as all of the team members need to be linguistically competant. Graphics must also be kept up to a spectacular standard through artistic talent, templates for similarity and more advanced graphic programs.</p>

<p><strong>Detail:</strong> To maintain the high standard of guides that is expected of Zybez RuneScape Help, every detail is taken into consideration prior to any release. All guides undergo a revision process, whereby team members ensure that content, spelling and grammar and visual aids are adequate and displayed well.</p>

<p><strong>Enthusiasm:</strong> Zybez RuneScape Help prides itself on the willingness of our massive user-base and Content Team to help. Enthusiasm is accomplished through ensuring that every member of the team is attaining useful experiences and enjoyment from their position. Being a member of the content team can teach you skills in xHTML, CSS and team work. If you become more involved further down the track, you may gain skills in Team Leadership/ Management and PHP.</p>

<p><strong>Innovation:</strong> Every successful organisation needs to innovate to stay ahead of the competition. Users don't want to see the same old content every single time they return to a website. They want to see something new, something fresh and interesting to use. Zybez is the leader in innovation for Runescape fans.</p>

<h2>Processes</h2>
<p>This section thoroughly outlines the processes by which you, as a Content Team member, must go through in order to complete your designated tasks. </p>

<p><strong>New Content:</strong></p>
<blockquote>All currently-being-worked-on Content is to be be entered in the <a href="testing_area.php">Testing Area</a>. Please use our guide wizards when creating new guides to make sure they are in the right layout. Rename an entry to "DELETE" if, and only if, YOU are finished with it.<br /><br />
Leave notes in the test area notepad for what needs to be done to a guide. If a guide's content has been completed, have it checked over by someone else for spelling/grammar/structural/presentational issues.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Updating Content:</strong></p>
<blockquote>This is the primary task of the Maintenance Crew, and includes all of our guides (not databases). A full list of possible updates required can be found in Maintenance Crew's Job Description, <a href="hierarchy.php">here</a>. If there is a larger task, such as rewriting a section of a guide, or adding a new section, post what needs to be done in the <a href="index.php">main notepad</a>'s to do list. If you see something in there you can do, by all means, go ahead and do it. Simply tag your name onto the end of the item, and update the notepad.<br /><br />

If you have a badword filter installed on your computer that will remove words such as death, blood, sex, or cock from guides, TURN IT OFF IMMEDIATELY. After submitting a change to a guide, ALWAYS go to the website and LOOK at that guide to make sure nothing has messed up! If your internet connection drops out in the middle of submitting a guide, it will delete half the guide. The same goes for Internal Server Errors - if one occurs while you're updating, you will have cached an error page, and users won't be able to see the guide.
<br /><br />
<b>When making big changes to guides, always hit ctrl + a, then ctrl + c to copy the text to your clipboard. Remember that all of Zybez's pages are Cached. If when you update a guide you get a "Sorry, Cache update failed" message, go back and submit the guide again to update its cache.</b></blockquote>

<p><strong>Maintaining Content:</strong></p>
<blockquote>You will notice some sections have "instructions" that you are able to show and hide, provided you have javascript enabled. Please read, understand and follow those instructions carefully. ESPECIALLY in the databases.<br /><br />
We receive at least a hundred corrections per week, oftentimes many more; not including price reports (of which we receive several hundred reports/week). This means that every single day, there is something you can do. So no matter if you come on 3 days a week, or 7 days a week, there will still be something to do. When fixing a correction, <strong>you must ensure that what the member has submitted is correct.</strong> If it is incorrect, or not-needed, delete the report. If the member asks a question and submits their email address (hover over their name to see it), you may only send them a reply if you have an @zybez.net email account.
<br /><br />If a guide needs a new image, use the <a href="upload.php">Upload Images</a> form and detail in the Upload Images notepad, what it is to be used for.<br /><br />
With suspending and banning people from using Correction Submission, try to use your own judgement when either suspending them yourselves, or requesting them to be banned. In both cases, leave the correction there if you are unsure, and ask in the message box.<br />
<b>Request a ban if:</b> the text is random and stretches the page a lot; the user posted a keylogger or malware infected website; there is swearing or flaming of any kind; or if the user has spammed a number of corrections.<br />
<b>Suspend if:</b> the correction submission is not related to anything at all (Eg: I like apples and oranges); or only mild flaming and the user has a -2 or worse rating.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Maintaining Databases:</strong></p>
<blockquote>This includes the calculators, shop database, item database, market price database, and monster database. When updating entries in the database, ensure that you use correct data, spelling, and grammar. The most important thing is sticking to the instructions and filling in as much information as possible.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Notepads:</strong></p>
<blockquote>Anyone is allowed to edit the notepads to add information, or anything that needs to be updated. If you're making a large message in a notepad, or have not refreshed the page in a while, please be careful. Check to see if anyone has edited that notepad recently in the logbook. If they have, copy what you were going to post, refresh the page, add what you wanted to say and submit it. This is just so we don't have people overwriting other people's messages.<br /><br />

To get to the General Notepad, click the "zybez editor" text in the header image. Here you may:
<ol>
<li>Make comments <b>below</b> the To Do List.</li>
<li>Add tasks to the To Do List for others to do. <b>Delete them from the list when you've made the changes</b>.</li>
</ol></blockquote>

   <table> 
    <tr>
     <td style="width: 16%; vertical-align: top;">
      <h4 style="margin: 0px; font-size: 10px;">Literacy skills</h4><br /></td> 
     <td>You must possess a high standard of literacy skills to be a part of the  Content Team. We need people who can re-write incoherent sentences,  paragraphs and/ or guides, write up new sections for guides, write  completely new guides etc. This does not mean you have to be the top in your class in english - we just can't use people who don't know how to properly structure and sequence sentences, paragraphs or guides.<br />
       <br /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td style="width: 16%; vertical-align: top;">
      <h4 style="margin: 0px; font-size: 10px;">RuneScape Knowledge</h4>
      <br /></td> 
     <td>You must have a high level of knowledge in regards to the playing of the game, its items, monsters, locations, quests etc etc. You will be  tested on your RuneScape knowledge upon submitting your application. This does not mean you are required to know <em>everything</em>; just enough to not have to ask a billion questions.<br />
       <br /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td style="width: 16%; vertical-align: top;">
      <h4 style="margin: 0px; font-size: 10px;">Graphics</h4><br /></td> 
     <td>As a bare minimum, you should be able to take <strong>.PNG quality</strong> screenshots from various stylistic angles; if you need this explained further upon being accepted, simply ask. It would be very helpful if you are a high quality pixel or vector artist or 3D Modeller, as we are always looking for those who are able to create custom images for our guides and features (note those created by Prince).<br /><br /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td style="width: 16%; vertical-align: top;">
      <h4 style="margin: 0px; font-size: 10px;">Web design</h4><br /></td> 
     <td>Though it is not necessarily required, it is helpful to have at least a basic knowledge of XHTML; this is merely for using tags to format text, spacing etc. If you are a good candidate, you will be taught these  skills - they are <strong>very</strong> easy to pick up on and very useful. <a href="xhtml.php"><b>CLICK HERE</b></a> for a short guide on XHTML.<br />

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Members of the Zybez RuneScape Help Content Team must pass the following requirements prior to being accepted.</p>

<table cellspacing="5">
 <tr>
  <td class="news">
   <table> 
    <tr>
     <td style="width: 16%; vertical-align: top;">
      <h4 style="margin: 0px; font-size: 10px;">Attitude</h4><br /></td>
     <td>Your attitude while reacting to personal attacks, topics, private messages, staff members and the like is vital in deciding who we should  hire; people with poor attitudes tend to overreact and do something rash that will put our website and its users at risk. Your attitude in the editor, on RSC, and on the corp forums will be monitored.<br />
       <br /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td style="width: 16%; vertical-align: top;">
      <h4 style="margin: 0px; font-size: 10px;">Committment</h4><br /></td>
     <td>You must be <strong>committed</strong> to Zybez. This means that <strong>Zybez always comes first</strong>; that is, ahead of <strong>any</strong> of your RuneScape Community duties (excl. Senior Moderators). This is because you may become inactive on Zybez, while moderating at RSC - this is unacceptable, there is always something to do on Zybez. If you are found to be inactive, you will be kicked from the team. Inactivity is classed as two weeks of doing nothing. Of course there are issues that may arise with school or work and these are recognised, so long as they don't go on forever. In the <a href="password.php">Change Password</a> section of the Editor, you are able to click a link and add some notes to indicate why you are inactive. Team Managers are able to see these messages.<br /><br /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 16%; vertical-align: top;"><h4 style="margin: 0px; font-size: 10px;">Reliability</h4><br /></td>
      <td>We must be able to rely upon you to take initiative to complete tasks with or without being asked to do so. You will be required to complete at least 35 actions per week; that's 5 per day, which is a miniscule  amount of work. Of course you can put yourself ahead of the rest by doing more work. If you do other tasks that do not give actions, but still help Zybez, it is up to the discretion of your team manager as to whether or not that is ok.</td>

     <td>If you are the leader of a team or the team's manager, you must find a <strong>suitable</strong> replacement for your position before you retire. This way it is more likely that Zybez will keep going if the managers up and leave.</b><br /><br /></td>

      <h4 style="margin: 0px; font-size: 10px;">Burnout</h4><br /></td>
     <td>Working on Zybez can be very tiring after a while, so try to regulate the amount of time you spend doing things. Listen to some music or get up and walk around every now and then. There is no expectation for you to spend countless hours every single day working on Zybez.<br /><br /></td>

You have been trusted with this position - <b>do NOT abuse it.</b><br /></td>
