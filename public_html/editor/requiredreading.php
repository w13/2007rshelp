<div class="title1">Guide to Content Standards on the Zybez Content Team</div>
<p>I've been noticing quite a few stuff ups lately from us on the content team, and my intentions for writing this guide are to teach what to make sure you know what you <strong>need</strong> to do and know what you need to <strong>NOT</strong> do.</p>
<div class="title2">Corrections</div>
<p>To bluntly say it in the most accurate way possible, some of us are action happy.  The managers and higher don't look at actions so much as we look at the work you've done.  I do, as well as other, conduct random actions checks where I will remember a correction in the listings, wait for someone to process it, and then question them as to how they came to the conclusion of what the appropriate action to take on the correction was.<br /><br />You need to be careful as to what you're fixing.  If you're just processing it on a whim, don't.  Always be 100% sure that you know the correction is wrong or right before you NF or fix it.  This is key to making sure that Zybez remains the best RuneScape help site out there. The one exception to this is Monster Database drops.  We do not have the time to sit at monsters for hours on end and that is why it's ok to trust your sense of logic then <strong>and only then</strong> for deciding how to handle a monster drop correction.  If it makes sense that the monster would drop it, then go ahead and put it in.</p>
<div class="title2">Databases</div>
<br /><div class="title3">Monster Database</div>
<p>Most of the database is self explanatory, however, this is to help you understand the aspect which are not.  First the pictures are one thing that need mentioning.  Most of you should know by now that monsters pictures should be taken in large view from the front with no splashes or obstructions in the way of the monster.  If you are uploading a monster that still needs cropped, save it as a .png file.  If you have cropped it, then upload as .gif. There are some things to keep in mind here:
<ol><li>File names are to be short.  weird_monkey_thing_level_43.gif is better saved as weirdmonkeything_43.gif.</li>
<li>Make sure there isn't another monster with the same file name.</li>
<li><strong>ALWAYS</strong> include the level of the monster at the end of the file name in order to reduce confusion.</li></ol>
Once you have realized these things, you may edit the file name into the monster entry.  This creates less work of Ben/Myst/myself when moving pictures</p>
<p><strong>Reminders for Adding Drops (BY Ryan P J):</strong><br />
Abbreviations: Do not use abbreviations. Spell out the name. Ex: "Rune scimmy" 
or "Steel c'bow" - BAD / "Rune scimitar" or "Steel crossbow" - GOOD<br />
Ranges: Separate the highest and lowest with a dash. Ex: "Coins (22, 44, 100)" - 
BAD / "Coins (22-100)" - GOOD<br />
Capitalization: Capitalize the FIRST word, leave the others lowercase. Ex: "Blue 
Skirt" - BAD / "Blue skirt" - GOOD<br />
Noted items: Precede the item name with "noted" (LOWERCASE). Ex: "Noted Copper 
ore (10)" - BAD / "noted Copper ore (10)" - GOOD<br />
Metal types: Spell out the metal type. For addy equipment but NOT bars or ores, 
use "adamant". Ex: "Mith battleaxe" - BAD / "Mithril battleaxe" - GOOD // "Adamantite 
boots" or "Adamant ores" - BAD / "Adamant boots" or "Adamantite ores" - GOOD<br />
Conjunctions: Do not use "and" or "or" in the DROPS or TOP DROPS sections.<br />
Potions: Put the number of doses in parenthesis. Ex: "Super attack 3-dose" BAD / 
"Super attack (3)" GOOD<br />
Clue scrolls: Using parenthesis, spell out "level" (LOWERCASE) then add a dash 
and the number. Ex: "Clue scroll (lvl 2)" - BAD / "Clue scroll (level-2)" - GOOD<br />
Helmets: Use "helm", not "helmet", "full", not "large", and "med", not "medium". 
Ex: "Rune full helmet" - BAD / "Rune full helm" - GOOD<br />
Square shields: Use "sq" and "shield". Ex: "Rune square" - BAD / "Rune sq 
shield" - GOOD<br />
Swords: Shortswords are just "sword"s. 2-handers are "2h sword"s. Ex: "Iron 
shortsword" or "Iron 2-hander" - BAD / "Iron sword" or "Iron 2h sword" - GOOD<br />
Gems: Use "Uncut gems". There's no need to spell out sapphire-diamond. As above, 
capitalize the FIRST word. Ex: "uncut Gems" - BAD / "Uncut gems" - GOOD<br />
Woodcutting axes: Use "axe", not "hatchet". Ex: "Mithril hatchet" - BAD / "Mithril 
axe" - GOOD<br />
Key halves: The correct name is "Half of a key". If you are ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN 
that it only drops ONE half of a key (teeth or loop exclusively), add it to the 
NOTES section.<br />
Dragon shield halves: The correct name is "Shield left half".<br />
Top drops: Put dragon items dropped in the Top Drops section. Half keys, clue 
scrolls, large rune items, and other valuable/rare items may also go there. 
Don't put it in DROPS if it's in TOP DROPS.<br />
If you want include extra information for an item, put it in NOTES. Ex: Man 
drops "Herbs (members only)" - BAD / Man drops "Herbs" NOTES: Herbs are members 
only OR: Herbs dropped are ranarr and above - GOOD<br />
Order: Put 100% drops first. Bones, then Coins, then other items (or other 100% 
drops, if applicable). Put similar items near each other.</p>

<br /><br /><div class="title3">Item Database</div>
<p>Not much can be said about this as most of you know the standards for this and handle them well.  The item background may be downloaded <a href="http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/2506/bgcc2.gif" title="Item Background">here</a>.  Only use the item background if you use a program that will allow you to paste an item on the background and have it automatically centered.  If you don't, then just screenshot it, crop it, and upload in Upload Images and someone that does will take care of it. If the weight of an item is unknown, use a "?" in the weight blank.  Little work needs done to this, but check the IDB Notebad for what needs done so that we can take it out of beta phase.</p>
<div class="title2">xHTML</div>
<p>First off, you may reference to Ben's guide on xHTML <a href="/editor/xhtml.php" title="xHTML Guide>here</a> and you should all be familiar with it.  You must always make sure that you are using valid xHTML Transitional.  You may go to <a href="http://validator.w3.org">this site</a> for a free validation check.  Just paste in the guide URL and if the URL contains "/development/" you will be required to enter the Zybezland username and password located at the top of the Testing Area notepad.  There will always be 2 errors because of the advertisements, but there should be no more than that.  If there is something you can not fix, post it in the Message Box and someone with the ability to fix it will promptly. If you see incorrect xHTML in a guide, fix it, or tell someone.</p>
<p>You must <strong>always</strong> use "alt" or "title" when putting a picture or link into guide.  Alt is for pictures (img tags) and title is for links (a tags).  The beginning of the title or alt should always start with "Zybez RuneScape Help's" then follow with whatever it's linking to/whatever the picture is.  An example of each can be found below:
<br /><br />&lt;a href="/skills.php?id=2" title="Zybez RuneScape Help's Fletching Guide"&gt;Fletching&lt;/a&gt;
<br /><br />&lt;img src="/img/idbimg/Harpoon.png" alt="Zybez RuneScape Help's Image of a Harpoon" /&gt;
<br /><br />On one last note, always wait until an image has been moved before using it.  Never ever ever use an /editor/uploads/ URL for an image, as the editor is secret and we intend to keep it that way.</p>
<div class="title2">Quest Guides</div>
<p>Ever since we switched to the new format, we're going to be extremely picky about these.  One of the biggest concerns is to include the strategy in the step.  The Quest Guide Wizard under the Tools & Features menu is to be used for creating these.  It will do most of the html work for you, you just have to fill in the necessary information.  Make sure notes are as short, yet accurate as possible.  Be sure to make images visible in the guide and provide links to larger versions of the pictures.  Be sure to change the "questfolder" in the top content as well as the length and difficulty ratings.</p>
<div class="title2">Images</div>
<p>All images need to be taken in PNG quality.  The only reason you ever have to veer away from this is if you're saving a picture with a transparent background, in which case you should save as a GIF.  Never ever put paint lines on an image.  If you need something pointed out, save a version without the lines, then a version with the lines, and a more graphics savvy member of the content team will update the picture with a better rendition of showing whatever needs highlighted. On one last note, when inserting a "(Picture)" link into a guide, the punctuation belongs after the parenthesis.  For example "You will need to attack the level 74 Tortoise (Picture)." <- Normally that link would work, but there's no sense in linking it here.</p>
<div class="title2">Trust</div>
<p>As Peter Parker's uncle said, "With great power comes great responsibility" and that does not differ here. We divulge a great deal of trust to you as a member of the content team as you now have access to edit the guides and other things here.  You are trusted with secret information, whether you see it posted in the Message Box, you're a member of the Upcoming Content Crew, or are higher up in the rankings.  No matter how much temptation is itchy and your back, you can <strong>not</strong> scratch it.  You must keep the information you learn of upcoming Zybez updates and other secretive information to yourself and  never tell your friends, no matter how trustworthy you think they are.</p>
<div class="title2">Reminders</div>
<p>Re-familarize yourself with these next two guides.  You should have read and understood them when joining the content team, but I want you all to be re-aquainted with your duties and what is expected of you here.  <a href="/editor/hierarchy.php" title="Job Descriptions">Job Descriptions guide.</a> <a href="/editor/intro.php" title="What We Do Here">What We Do Here guide.</a>
<br /><br />Familiarize with <a href="/community/index.php?showtopic=300070" title="Standards">this</a> sticky as even though much of it is in BBCode, it will help show you the standards of content.  Please tell me anything you feel should be added to this guide.  Thanks for reading,
<br /><br />~Jer</p>
