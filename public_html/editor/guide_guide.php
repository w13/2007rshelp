<div class="title1">Introduction and General Guide Advice</div>
<p>Use this guide as a reference if you are unsure how to progress when an update is released, or alternatively if you just want to produce a new guide afresh. Although writing a guide can be quite simple, for many beginners it can be a bit overwhelming as to <em>just where</em> to start. You should already be familiar Zybez's pledges to innovation, quality, and detail regarding our content. Refer to the HTML or Image guide if you are confused over those aspects of work. The table below can remind you of common mistakes that can be made when writing guides.</p>

<p>When you're making a guide, particularly your first few, don't try to over complicate things. Put down what you need to and then try to experiment with the layout or how the guide is divided afterwards. You should of course be keeping back ups or work as you go, and if you use the quest guide wizard as a sandbox nothing can go wrong.</p>

<div class="title2">General Update Information</div>
<p>As a general rule over in-game updates, communication with each other is more important than anything. Speak to one another in-game, over the shoutbox, in our IRC, or over MSN. Just be sure to be discrete, keeping zybez information secret and not endangering your RuneScape account.</p>

<div class="info"; >JaGex often releases the biggest update of the month on a Tuesday, particularly if its in the first week, or if no actual update preceded it in the week before. <br />Why? Who knows, maybe they like to run final checks on Monday, or perhaps they are too lazy to finish work properly on Friday ready for Monday. But as a general rule of thumb this has held out for almost two years now.</div>



<a name="2"></a>
<div class="title1">Quest Releases</div>
<p>In many ways quests can be the easiest updates to handle, but if they are long or complicated adventures it can be a lot of work. More so the content team will be attempting to release Quest guides before any of our rivals. The most crucial element to creating quest guides from scratch is dividing tasks between those who are online helping with the update. Always use the Quest guide Wizard at the top of the editor. Below are some key guidelines to follow when producing a quest guide.</p>


<p>1. Log on and start doing the quest. Even if you know you can't finish a quest because of your combat level, just by having more editors online trying things out will produce a better guide. You will be more likely to notice if questions or items are different for every player for instance, or when writing key descriptions they are more likely to reflect interpretations of all players.
<p>2. As you are playing, make brief but exact notes of everything you have to do. For instance, "Walk to Varrock. Speak to NPC. Say you'll help him beat PERSON. Bring them 5 Oak logs from bank."
<br />Make sure you get names and levels correct. This means that notes from a potentially long quest can be written up and made into a guide by an editor who hasn't even started the quest if you have to leave prematurely. Nothing slows the process down more than when only one editor can comprehend the rough notes for a quest.*</p>
<p>3. Take plenty of pictures, but make sure the majority of the images you use are showing players what to do, or showing them where something is. A cutscene may look appealing and it can be used in the guide, but 10 images of cutscenes won't help players! If there is a sequence or puzzle try to take pictures of the different stages or the final product. Always get an intact scroll picture!</p>
<p>4. If you can't do a quest but want to help you can fill in top information for the quest, e.g. the rewards, requirements and the quote, all of which are easily read on runescape.com or by browsing posts on RSC news topics. It's faster if you are creating the guide in the Test Area, and whoever is doing the quest is making notes using a notepad (the Swiftkit notepad is ideal since you don't have to even switch windows). A really good idea is whilst someone does a quest, get them to feed you their notes as they go, so that you can begin to flesh them out and format them into an actual quest guide.</p>
<p>5. When you are writing up notes for a quest guide <em>always</em> give as many sensible alternative methods of accomplishing each task. For example for, "Bring them 5 Oak logs," you can also suggest cutting nearby trees down, or if a player must reach a location list as many methods of good travel possible, not just "teleport using an amulet of glory," but "Players who have completed X quest can use Y transport," (e.g. Gnome gliders, mining carts, trains, other jewellery).</p>
<p>6. Remember more than anything that many, many different kinds of players will be using our content. You need to suggest methods that everyone can accomplish. Offer methods for both high and low level players, but don't pander to one group in supporting them.</p>

<div class="info"; >* - You can of course write a guide more fluently as you go, but this can slow down how fast a guide is made. Even if you feel that you have the ability, it's best not to try until you have helped with several quest updates.</div>

<div class="title1">Miscellaneous Guides</div>
<p>Miscellaneous guides being generally quite random or possibly obscure in their content by nature can be hard to get off the ground. Importantly remember to offer actual help in these guides. It is all too easy when a new miscellaneous update is introduced to just <em>describe</em> and <em>inform</em> about the subject. As a help site we must always offer advice, tips, and good strategies. <strong>Don't settle even if something is "self explanatory,"</strong> after all RuneScape is played by all age groups.</p>
<p>Since Misc. guides will always vary so much there is little to suggest in your actual method of making the guides if you are unsure. However if you are really stuck use formats from similar guides to create the rough layout for your new guide. Once you have done that begin to adapt it to how the activity, mini-quest, or area requires. If the update you are dealing with is particularly large don't feel afraid to go ahead and request information. Post a topic in the Content Submission forum, especially if it is something high level orientated. A good example of when this was necessary was the release of the God Wars Dungeon.</p>
<p>As with all updates having as many editors online will help, remember that the requirements can almost be <em>anything</em> with misc. guides.</p>

<a name="4"></a>
<div class="title1">Mini Games</div>
<p>A frequent issue with mini game guides being produced is how to structure information that you need to convey. Especially with more complex games it can be difficult to not repeat information, or instead have it spread out awkwardly. To resolve any problems like this try an approach similar to below:

<p>Always put an introduction and then how to reach or access the mini game in first.
<br />A. If the the mini game is based entirely within a set enclosed location, it is usually best to explain the interface first and each part's function.</li>
<br /><br />B. If the mini game is more complex and involving a wider range of skills, it is better to explain the objectives of the game, and then to attach interface icons to each action as you explain.</p>

<p>Mini games also will often favour a certain niche of players that the content team may not actually possess. Write what you can, and then consult players or willing RSC staff who <em>do</em> actively use the mini game. If needed Zybez can give credit to players in the strategies or recommendations for certain games, just be sure to standardise what we receive if they write it themselves.</p>
