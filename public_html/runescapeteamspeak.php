<p>Q: <b>What is TeamSpeak</b>? What is this?<br />
<span style="display:block; margin-left:15px;">A: Teamspeak is a <b>voice-chat</b> program. It has various <b>chat-rooms</b> available to you once you get on our server.</span>
</p>
<p>

<span style="display:block; margin-left:15px;">A: <a href="http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads" target="_blank">Click here.</a> Scroll down, and find your operating system.</span>
</p>
<p>
Q: Do I need a mic or <b>headset?</b><br />
<span style="display:block; margin-left:15px;">A: <b>Yes.</b> It's all voice-chat. Using a headset is much easier than a mic+speakers.</span>
</p>
<p>
Q: What good is this?<br />
<span style="display:block; margin-left:15px;">A: Suppose you're going <b>PKing</b> with your <b>friends</b>, or you've got a <b>clan war</b>. <b>Fast communication</b> is very <b>important</b>. You don't have time to move your hands off the mouse to type in Runescape chat. Keep your mouse in your hand, and use a headset to voice-chat with your clan. Many many many people use Teamspeak in <b>hardcore PKing</b> games like World of Warcraft and Guild Wars.</span>
</p>
<p>
Q: Do I have to be PKing or Clanning to use this?<br />

</p>
<p>
Q: What is the <b>capacity?</b><br />
<span style="display:block; margin-left:15px;">A: Right now, it's <b>30 max people.</b> But if you guys need more, we'll increase the capacity as needed.</span>
</p>
<p>
Q: We're having a clan war, will other people <b>disturb us?</b><br />
<span style="display:block; margin-left:15px;">A: There are lots of <b>'sections' (rooms)</b> you can join (for example, "RS Chat" room, whatever's empty).</span>
