Tactic: Take a long range weapon and stay behind the rocks across bridge or at other side of lava river (combat 41+ only advised if staying at other side of river due to poison scorpions). From here you can get a good, decent ranging spot (or combat if using halberd).

Additional Information: Not terribly good experience. The drops are useful in most cases. Their respawn rate is long for their level. They help guard the gate to the blue dragons den with the lesser demons. They have the tendency to wander pretty far
